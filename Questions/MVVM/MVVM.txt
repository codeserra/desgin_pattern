MVVM stands for Model View View Model
It tells how to organize and structure your code to write maintainable, testable and extensible applications.
Model − It simply holds the data and has nothing to do with any of the business logic.
ViewModel − It acts as the link/connection between the Model and View and makes stuff look pretty.
View − It simply holds the formatted data and essentially delegates everything to the Model.
